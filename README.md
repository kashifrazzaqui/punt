# punt
punt is a cli tool that makes `adb logcat` better. 

```
adb logcat | punt.py
```

## Features
* Automatically track your apps logs even if the PID changes when your app crashes or restarts
* Save filters in a configuration file so you can easily switch between different configuration for different apps
* Run filters which are quite challenging to run on the adb logcat command line, two important use cases are 
    * Select all log lines which are generated by your app but remove some specific matches (using simple strings or regex)
    * Select all log lines which are generated by other apps but have some specific matches (usings simple strings or regex)
* Automatically save logs for each session to disk - all day. Each line is prefixed with dir name of current logs for easy reference
* Select custom log levels such as just "verbose" and "fatal"
* Nice colored formatting on screen
* Track process memory usage and thread count
* Easily save and reuse configuration/filters

## Install

```
git clone git@github.com:kashifrazzaqui/punt.git punt
cd punt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure
punt reads the PUNT_CONFIG environment variable for the full path of your config file, set it like so
```
export $PUNT_CONFIG="~/.punt_configs/my_first_config.conf"
```
or set it up permanently in your bash/zshr file

if you want to change to another configuration, just export the path to PUNT_CONFIG and restart punt

### Sample config
```
pids = com.facebook.alohaworkvc #your app package name
reject = words, or_comma_separated, regex_patterns #log lines from your package containing these words will be ignored
log_dir = ~/logs # your directory for saving logs; each time you start a punt session, it creates a new sub directory to save files under this
log_levels = vdiwef #chose which log levels you want, for example, no info is "vdwef"
file_size = 25000 #each file is saved using format "log-n.txt" with so many lines per file
```

## Running
"""
cd punt # directory where you cloned the git repo
adb logcat | punt.py
